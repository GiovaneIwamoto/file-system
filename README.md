# FILE SYSTEM

### **OVERVIEW**

Simple file system project inspired by UNIX-like file systems. The project aims to implement a basic hierarchical directory structure with support for creating, deleting, and managing files and directories. The file system also handles disk space management, allowing files and directories to be dynamically created and deleted, thus managing free space on the disk.

### **NOTE**

This project was developed based on a predefined code structure provided as a starting point. While these files formed the foundation of the implementation, additional changes and new files were made to achieve the desired functionality.

The provided code structure helped set the project's direction and provided essential functions for handling disk access and reading/writing data blocks. However, to create a functional and complete file system, modifications were necessary, including adding helper functions, improving code organization, and implementing additional features.
